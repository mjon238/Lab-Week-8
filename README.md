Working on the assignment in this lab
LAB Week 8 Reflection

I basically just started the assignment this lab. I filled in the necessary information and then worked to find out what module I had to use. I got 3, so I can pick any language I want. I'll probably use Python, although I havent used it before, it seems like a good language to learn.

Next I started working on the snakes and ladders problem, while it took a couple reads to really understand what was going on, I get the gist of it now. 

Towards the end of the lab I progressed through 3.1 and 3.2. I used Google and the infosys modules to guide me through solving the problems.

I should finish the lab this weekend and submit in time for the due date on Monday
